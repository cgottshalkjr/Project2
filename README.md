**FREE SPIRITS** is a cocktail recipe app. We wanted to make an app where a user could create an account, log in, and have a personal profile. Each profile contains a shelf. We wanted to make this app catered to only finding recipes with what you have in your liquor cabinet at home.



### INSTRUCTIONS 
---
Navigate your way to the sign in page at the top of this readme. We have created a user login for you to test `Username: GuestLogin` `Password: guest` 
Or create a whole new account for yourself. If you do make sure the photo field is supplied with a link to a `jpg` or `png` file. 
Once  you are in the site click `start` or `shelf` start to add ingredients to the shelf. Once you have your ingredients click `Search Recipes`. This will return all the recipes you can make with what you have in your shelf. If you see one you like, click the `Add to Favorites` button and then navigate your way to `Faves` and they will always be stored in our database.

We had tasks broken up pretty evenly. Aliesa and Leah mainly worked with Front-End. Chris and Melissa mainly worked in Back-end. We all chipped in where needed though and worked together.
